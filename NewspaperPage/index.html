                <h2>Text</h2>
                <p>
                    In literary theory, a text is any object that can be &quot;read&quot;, whether this object is a work
                    of literature,a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It
                    is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative message. 
                    <img src="images/06.jpg" width="172" height="134" class="leftimg"/>
                     [1] This set of symbols is considered in terms of the informative message's content, rather than in
                    terms of its physical form or the medium in which it is represented. Within the field of literary
                    criticism, &quot;text&quot; also refers to the original information content of a particular piece of
                    writing; that is, the &quot;text&quot; of a work is that primal symbolic arrangement of letters as
                    originally composed, apart from later alterations, deterioration, commentary, translations,
                    paratext, etc. Therefore, when literary criticism is concerned with the determination of a
                    &quot;text&quot;, it is concerned with the distinguishing of the original information content from
                    whatever has been added to or subtracted from that content as it appears in a given textual document
                    (that is, a physical representation of text). Since the history of writing predates the concept of
                    the &quot;text&quot;, most texts were not written with this concept in mind. Most written works fall
                    within a narrow range of the types described by text theory. The concept of &quot;text&quot; becomes
                    relevant if and when a &quot;coherent written message is completed and needs to be referred to
                    independently of the circumstances in which it was created

                <h2>And now about NewsPapers</h2>
                <p>A newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information about current events.
                   Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics, business, sports and art, and often
                   include materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts, reviews of local services, obituaries,
                   birth notices, crosswords, editorial cartoons, comic strips, and advice columns. Most newspapers are
                   businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and
                   advertising revenue. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often
                   metonymically called newspapers. Newspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on
                   cheap, low-grade paper called newsprint). However, today most newspapers are also published on
                   websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely. Newspapers
                   developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for businessmen. By the early 19th century, many
                   cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers. Some newspapers with high
                   editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of
